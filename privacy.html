        <p><em>Last Updated: <span class="current-date">March 29, 2025</span></em></p> <!-- JS will update date -->

        <p>Jacob Hulse ("I", "me", "my") operates the website located at https://clownai.github.io ("Site"). This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use this Site and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
        <p>This website is primarily informational and designed to showcase my work. As such, **I do not actively collect personally identifiable information** through this site itself, such as through user accounts or complex forms.</p>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>The only potential collection of personal information might occur if you choose to contact me directly via the provided email link. In this case, I would receive your email address and any information you voluntarily provide in your message. This information will only be used to respond to your inquiry.</p>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Log Data & Cookies</h2>
        <p>Like many site operators, the hosting provider (GitHub Pages) may collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Site ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of the Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and other statistics. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized and used for basic traffic analysis by the hosting provider.</p>
        <p>This site does not currently use "cookies" to store information specifically. However, third-party services linked to (if any) or the hosting platform itself might use cookies.</p>
        <!-- Optional: Add section if using Analytics -->
        <!--
        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Analytics</h2>
        <p>I may use third-party Service Providers like Google Analytics to monitor and analyze the use of our Service. Google Analytics tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.</p>
        -->

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is important, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect any potential Personal Data received via email, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>This Site may contain links to other sites that are not operated by me. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Contact Me</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact me via the email provided on the <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>.</p>

        <p class="mt-5 text-muted"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a sample Privacy Policy and may not cover all legal requirements for your situation or jurisdiction. Consider consulting with a legal professional for advice tailored to your specific circumstances.</p>
